## ðŸ—„ SQL Analysis

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Data Cleaning (`01_data_cleaning.sql`)

* Removed missing customer IDs, negative quantities, and prices.
* Added a new field: **Revenue = Quantity Ã— Price**.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Top Products (`02_top_products.sql`)

* Identified **Top 10 Products by Revenue**.
* Identified **Top 10 Products by Quantity Sold**.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Monthly Revenue Trends (`03_monthly_trends.sql`)

* Aggregated revenue by **Month** to track seasonal trends.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Top Countries (`04_top_countries.sql`)

* Ranked **Top 10 countries by revenue** (excluding UK).

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) (`05_customer_lifetime_value.sql`)

* Calculated **Total Revenue per Customer** to identify high-value customers.

### ðŸ”¹ 6. RFM Analysis (`06_rfm_analysis.sql`)

* Segmented customers by:

  * **Recency** â†’ Days since last purchase
